## EDUCATION BACKGROUND
* Ph.D in Physics, (I don't know now)
* B.S. in Physics, Shandong University, 2025.6 (expected)
(Supplementary:	In fact I have transferred my major from Mechanical Engineering to Physics in second year, shifting academic focus.)

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
* **Internal Three-Dimensional Structure of Nucleon**
  * Repeated part of a master's thesis (DOI: CNKI:CDMD:2.1017.147177) by calculating structure and fragmentation functions in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering.
  * Identified a minor calculation error in a particle physics book (ISBN: 978-7-03-047551-0, P272).
  * Gained a comprehensive understanding of the quark model and parton model.
  * Developed computational and analytical skills in QFT.

* **Research on SNO+ Experiment**
  * Conducted research on neutrino oscillation parameters from the perspectives of group theory.
  * Investigated experimental setups and methodologies for neutrinoless double-beta decay.
  * Completed shadowing shift training as part of the experimental team.
  * Enhanced skills in team coordination, time management, and meeting organization.

## ACTIVITIES
* **14th Chinese Particle Physics Academic Conference**
  * Attended to gain insights into recent developments in hadron physics.
  * Served as a conference volunteer, responsible for photography and post-production tasks.
  
* **ICTP-AP Summer Camp**
  * Explored the latest research in particle physics, focusing on gravitational waves and cosmology.
  
* **TDLI Astro-Division 2023 Winter Camp**
  * Expanded knowledge in astrophysics through lectures and hands-on experience.
  * Simulated the unstable evolution process of stellar systems.
  * Acquired programming experience in Linux.

## AWARDS
